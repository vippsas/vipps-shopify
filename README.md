# Vipps for Shopify

The Vipps product page: [Vipps for Shopify](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/shopify/).

The plugin is available from the [Shopify app store](https://apps.shopify.com/vipps?locale=nb).

## Description

Official Vipps Payment for Shopify. More than 4.3 million Norwegians use Vipps. Give them a fast and familiar shopping experience.

This is the official Vipps plugin that provides a direct integration with Shopify. Now you can let your customers choose Vipps directly in the checkout.

You can also do important back office tasks such as capture and refund directly from Shopify. Easy for your customer and easy for you.

Read [information from Vipps](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/shopify/) about the plugin.

## Vipps Express Checkout
Vipps does not have a solution for Vipps Express Checkout (Vipps Hurtigkasse) in Shopify.
This is due to limitations on Shopify's side, and if Shopify makes changes that
make Vipps Hurtigkasse possible, we will add this functionality.

## Vipps Payment
When you enable this plugin, your customers will be able to choose Vipps as a payment method directly in the checkout. There is no need to go via a third party payment method. If your customer chooses Vipps, the customer fills in the contact information and is then asked to enter the phone number in the Vipps dialogue. Then the customer confirms the payment in the Vipps app. The order is now completed and are now stored in your Shopify store.
