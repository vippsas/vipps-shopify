# Vipps for Shopify

Vipps does **_not_** yet have a solution for Shopify.

We are seeing a lot of interest for Shopify, and we have contacted Shopify to get access to a test/development environment. This is taking some time.

Until there is an official Vipps solution for Shopify, 
the best solution is to use a PSP (paymenty service provider) that supports both Shopify and Vipps, 
like Quickpay: https://quickpay.net/no/

The standard Vipps eCommerce API is available at https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started, and the Shopify API is available at https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started

Vipps does have open source plugins for 
[WooCommerce](https://www.vipps.no/bedrift/vipps-pa-nett/woocommerce) 
and 
[Magento](https://www.vipps.no/bedrift/vipps-pa-nett/magento).

If you have further questions, please [contact us](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/contact.md).
