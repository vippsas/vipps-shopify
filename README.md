## Description

Official Vipps/MobilePay Payment for Shopify. Branded locally as MobilePay in Denmark and Finland, and as Vipps in Norway. One platform gathering more than 11 million users and more than 400,000 merchants across the Nordics. Give your users an easy, fast and familiar shopping experience.

Increase your conversion rate by letting your customers pay with a fast, secure and convenient payment method. Vipps MobilePay allows users to make quick and easy payments using their mobile phone, without the need for entering credit card details or other sensitive information.

You can also do important back office tasks such as capture and refund directly from Shopify. Easy for your customer and easy for you.
This is the official Vipps plugin that provides a direct integration with Shopify. Now you can let your customers choose Vipps/MobilePay directly in the checkout.

## Express Checkout

Vipps MobilePay does not have a solution for Express Checkout in Shopify.
This is due to limitations on Shopify's side, and if Shopify makes changes that
make Express Checkout possible, we will add this functionality.

## Vipps/MobilePay Payment

When you enable this plugin, your customers will be able to choose Vipps or MobilePay as a payment method directly in the checkout. There is no need to go via a third party payment method. If your customer chooses Vipps or MobilePay, the customer fills in the contact information and is then asked to enter the phone number in the Vipps/MobilePay dialogue. Then the customer confirms the payment in the Vipps/MobilePay app. The order is now completed and are now stored in your Shopify store.

- After 1-2 days, you will get an email with login details to the Merchant Portal, [portal.vippsmobilepay.com](https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com/), where you can get the API credentials.
